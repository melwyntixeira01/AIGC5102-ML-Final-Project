AIGC5102 – Machine Learning Final Project

This repository contains the final project for the AIGC5102 Introduction to Machine Learning course. The goal of the project was to build and evaluate multiple machine learning models for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset.

Project Overview:

The project applies several ML techniques to classify digits (0–9). Models were built using Azure Machine Learning Designer and Automated ML. Each model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score. The results were compared to identify the best-performing approach.
